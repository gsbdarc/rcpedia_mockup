# How Do I Get Access to the Yens?

By default, GSB faculty, staff, PhD students, and research fellows have access to the Yens.

!!! tip
    Learn more about the Yens and how to connect [here](/yen/index.html)

If you are not part of this group, you will need to have sponsored access from a GSB faculty member. You can find out more information about this [here](/_policies/collaborators).

## Other page
## Why Can't I Log into the Yens?
Here are some common access issues that Yen users run into:

## No Sponsored Yen Access

## Yen Access not Renewed

## Yens Down for Maintenance
For security reasons, the Yens are scheduled to be patched and updated roughly every two months. Downtime dates are posted as part of the greeting message whenever you log onto a machine:
```
📅⏰⚠️  --> Next Downtime: March 26, 2020
```
Furthermore, we will send out a reminder message to Yen users via e-mail prior to any scheduled downtime. Please be sure to complete any jobs and log out of the Yens prior to any scheduled reboot so that you don't lose valuable work. Downtimes due to scheduled maintenance will usually take half a day.

## Remote Access
If you are attempting to access the Yen servers from outside of Stanford, you may need to first connect to a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Please try downloading and using [Stanford's VPN client](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/vpn) before attempting to connect to the Yens again.

## Use Full yen.stanford.edu Address
If you run into an error such as this one,

```
ssh: Could not resolve hostname yen1: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

then you are probably not entering in the full address of the server that you are trying to log into. Instead, please be sure to explicitly type:

```
ssh <SUNetID>@yen1.stanford.edu
```

## Logging In
!!! important
    You should have a SUNet ID as a prerequisite to use the Yen server and know your password.

Yen access is provided in the following two ways:

1. Automatically granted to GSB faculty, postdocs, PhD Students, and Research Fellows
2. <a href="/_policies/collaborators" target="_blank">Collaborator access</a> sponsored by a GSB faculty member

If you belong to one of the above two groups, you can use the Yen servers! Below are the instructions for connecting to the Yen servers.

We can use a Secure Shell (SSH) protocol to securely connect from your local laptop to another computer such as a remote Yen server.
Below are the instructions for connecting from a Mac / Linux OS laptop and a Windows laptop.


## Login
Open a terminal or a Moba terminal. Enter the SSH command to login into the server as shown below (Note: replace SUNetID with **your SUNet ID** and do not type the brackets!). You will
be asked to enter your password and authenticate with Duo. You will **not** see your password being typed.

```bash
$ ssh <SUNetID>@yen.stanford.edu
```

For example, I login with:
```bash
$ ssh nrapstin@yen.stanford.edu
```

If the login is successful, you will see something similar to the following:

You can also log into a specific interactive yen server. Choose what yen server you would like to connect to (yen1, yen2, yen3, yen4 or yen5).
Here is the example of how to login to the yen3 server:


```bash
$ ssh <SUNetID>@yen3.stanford.edu
```

!!! tip
    If you do not want to type `ssh yen.stanford.edu` every time you want to login... Save an alias in your `~/.bash_profile` with a shorhand for the yen servers. For example, my `~/.bash_profile` has this line `alias yen="ssh yen.stanford.edu"`. Then instead of typing `ssh yen.stanford.edu`, I simply type `yen` from the Terminal.

!!! tip
    If your user name on your computer is the same as your SUNet ID, you can simply type `ssh yen.stanford.edu`.

## With a graphical interface

If your work requires a Graphical User Interface (GUI) such as MATLAB IDE or RStudio or you need to pop up separate windows of
any kind, you will need to login to the Yen servers with the X forwarding enabled.

**For Mac OS**, you need to
have <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/" target="_blank">XQuartz</a> installed first. XQuartz usually requires restarting your computer before you can use it.

**For Windows**, you need to have <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/" target="_blank">MobaXterm</a> installed first.

The steps to login with a graphical interface are the same as the above except that you need to add a Y-flag in the SSH command.
Again, in the Terminal window, type:

```bash
$ ssh -Y <SUNetID>@yen.stanford.edu
```

When prompted, type your SUNet ID password. Then, complete the two-factor authentication process.
After you successfully login, check that X-forwarding works correctly. Choose any of the following commands and type it in
the yen command line interface as all of them will pop up a window if everything is working correctly - `xeyes`, `xcalc`, `xlogo` or `xclock`
(or choose your favorite X11 command line program).

# Collaborators on the Yens

## SUNet IDs for External Collaborators

You can request a SUNet ID for a collaborator external to the GSB. In particular, this is a prerequisite for non-GSB collaborators to access the [Yen servers](/_getting_started/yen-servers){:target="_blank"}. SUNet ID sponsorship is managed by University IT and you can request an ID [here](https://sponsorship.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

## Yen Access for External Collaborators

Any member of the GSB research community can use the Yens by default - this includes research fellows, postdocs, PhD students, and faculty members.  

Faculty members may **sponsor** Yen access for other external collaborators with an active SUNet ID by adding those collaborators to a shared project space. A shared project space is provisioned for each new project on the Yens and has a faculty owner, as well as collaborators who can access the shared space. Each project space is assigned a project space workgroup (`gsb-rc:[faculty-SUNet]-[projectname]`) that can be managed as described [here](/_policies/workgroups){:target="_blank"}. External collaborators added to this project space workgroup will be granted immediate access to the Yens.

!!! warning
    As described on [this page](/_policies/workgroups){:target="_blank"}, users can be added as either Members and/or Administrators of a workgroup. Given that Administrators of a workgroup have the power to add other users, please be mindful of who you grant Administrator privileges to. It is recommended that you only add external collaborators as Members of your project space workgroup.


### Don't have a project yet?

If you don't already have a project set up on the Yens, you can request one [here](http://darc.stanford.edu/newstorage){:target="_blank"}. The DARC team will process this request, and you can ask us to give your collaborators access in the form.

### Already have a project?

If you already have a project directory, there is a similarly named workgroup associated with access to that directory.  You can view workgroups and add users on [this website](https://workgroup.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

!!! warning
    It is *your responsibility* to ensure that only active collaborators are members of this workgroup.

In accordance with the minimum security and auditing guidelines set by [Stanford ISO](https://uit.stanford.edu/organization/information-security-office){:target="_blank"}, we will send you emails on a quarterly basis asking you to review the list of researchers in your workgroup.

!!! warning
    The collaborator you are sponsoring will need to have a valid SUNet ID to access the Yens. If they do not have one, you will need to [request one for them](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sponsorship){:target="_blank"}. Users with valid SUNets will have access to the Yens, however they will require full sponsorship to access [JupyterHub](/_getting_started/jupyter/){:target="_blank"}.

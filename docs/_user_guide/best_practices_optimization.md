We have licensed and installed optimization software on the Yens that the GSB researchers can use including 
[Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com){:target="_blank"}, [Knitro](https://www.artelys.com/solvers/knitro){:target="_blank"} and [AMPL](https://ampl.com){:target="_blank"}. In this guide, we will show how to use the licensed optimization software interactively on the Yens, in Jupyter notebooks and in Slurm. 

## Software Overview
- **Gurobi** is a state-of-the-art mathematical optimization solver that delivers high-performance solutions for linear programming (LP), mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), quadratic programming (QP), mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP), and other related problems. Known for its robustness and speed, Gurobi is designed to efficiently solve large-scale optimization problems.
- **Knitro** is an advanced solver for nonlinear optimization. It offers algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth 
problems, making it particularly effective for solving large-scale, complex nonlinear problems. Knitro is well-suited for applications requiring high precision.
- **AMPL** (A Mathematical Programming Language) is a powerful and flexible algebraic modeling language for linear and 
nonlinear optimization problems. It is designed to express complex problems with simple, readable formulations. AMPL's strength lies in its ability to integrate with various solvers, including Gurobi and Knitro.

## Running Software Interactively on the Yens

#### Gurobi
### Running Gurobi in Python

Because the Yens already have Gurobi software and Gurobi Python interface installed, we simply need to access them
by loading the `gurobipy3` [module](/_getting_started/modules/){:target="_blank"}.
 
**Environment Setup**

Load Gurobi module:
```bash
$ ml gurobipy3
```

Next, create a new [Python virtual environment](/_user_guide/best_practices_python_env/){:target="_blank"} using `venv` package. 
This virtual environment will be used across interactive Yen nodes, Slurm nodes, and as a Jupyter kernel.

To make the virtual environment sharable, we make it in a shared location on the Yens such as a faculty project directory, and not in a user’s home directory.

Let's navigate to the shared project directory:

```bash
$ cd <path/to/project>
```

Create a new virtual environment, called `opt`, for example:

```bash
$ python -m venv opt
```
You can also choose a different name instead of `opt` in this step. 

Then, activate the virtual environment with:
```bash
$ source opt/bin/activate
```

You should see `(opt):` prepended to the prompt: 
```bash
(opt): $
```

Finally, install required Python packages with `pip` (this step will take awhile):

```bash
(opt) $ pip install numpy pandas ipykernel threadpoolctl scipy gurobipy
```

The `ipykernel` module is needed to turn this virtual environment into a Jupyter kernel at a later step,
the `threadpoolctl` and `scipy` packages are used in the example, and [`gurobipy`](https://pypi.org/project/gurobipy/){:target="_blank"} is a Python interface to Gurobi. 

After the packages are installed, start the Python REPL by typing `python`:
```bash
(opt) $ python
```

Test that you can import `gurobipy`:

```python
Python 3.10.12 (main, Nov 20 2023, 15:14:05) [GCC 11.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from gurobipy import *
```

Exit the REPL.
 
If you are done working interactively and want to deactivate the virtual environment and remove all modules, run:
```bash
$ deactivate
$ module purge
```


The environment is now set up to run your Python scripts that import `gurobipy` on interactive Yen nodes.
Remember that the `module load` command and virtual environment activation is only active in the current shell.

**Important:** You need to load the `gurobipy3` module and activate your `venv` environment every time you login to the Yens
before running the interactive Python scripts that use `gurobipy` package. 


### Running Gurobi in R
Similar to running Gurobi in Python, Gurobi R package is also installed and available system-wide to use on the Yens. 
You do not need to install anything into your user R library. 

**Environment Setup**

To use Gurobi software with R, you simply need to load both modules:

```bash
$ ml gurobi R
```

List loaded modules:
```bash
$ ml 
Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) gurobi/10.0.0   2) rstudio/2022.07.2+576   3) R/4.3.0
```

Launch interactive R:
```bash
$ R
```

Then you can load the `gurobi` R package:

```R
R

R version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21) -- "Already Tomorrow"

Type 'q()' to quit R.



> library('gurobi')
Loading required package: slam
>
```

You can now run the R scripts to solve the optimization problem using Gurobi on interactive Yen nodes.

!!!Important
    You need to load the `gurobi` and `R` modules every time you login to the Yens
    before running the interactive R scripts that use `gurobi` R package.

Note, that if you want to use an older Gurobi version, you will need to install `gurobi` R package to your user
R library. 

Load R and the older Gurobi module:

```
$ module purge
$ ml R gurobi/9.5.2
```

Start R by typing `R`, then install a personal `gurobi` package that links to Gurobi 9:

```R
> install.packages("/software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi952/linux64/R/gurobi_9.5-2_R_4.2.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL)
Installing package into ‘/home/users/$USER/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2’
(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)
* installing *binary* package ‘gurobi’ ...
* DONE (gurobi)
> library("gurobi")
Loading required package: slam
>
```

Quit R. You can now run the R scripts to solve the optimization problem using Gurobi on interactive Yen nodes.


#### AMPL with Knitro Solver
### Running AMPL with Knitro Solver in Python

Because the Yens already have Knitro and AMPL software installed, we simply need to load the appropriate [modules](/_getting_started/modules/){:target="_blank"}.
 
**Environment Setup**

Load both modules:
```bash
$ ml ampl knitro
```
You can check currently loaded modules with:

```
$ ml
Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) ampl/20231031   2) knitro/14.0.0
```

You can get details about a specific module with:

```
$ ml show knitro
```
which shows you useful details about `PATH` modifications when the module is loaded:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   /software/modules/Core/knitro/14.0.0.lua:

prepend_path("MATLABPATH","/software/non-free/knitro/14.0.0/knitromatlab")
prepend_path("PYTHONPATH","/software/non-free/knitro/14.0.0/examples/Python")
```

Next, create a new [Python virtual environment](/_user_guide/best_practices_python_env/){:target="_blank"}. using `venv` package. 
This virtual environment will be used across interactive Yen nodes, Slurm nodes, and as a Jupyter kernel.

To make the virtual environment sharable, we make it in a shared location on the Yens such as a faculty project directory, and not in a user’s home directory.

Let's navigate to the shared project directory:

```bash
$ cd <path/to/project>
```

Create a new virtual environment, called `opt`, for example:

```bash
$ python -m venv opt
```
You can also choose a different name instead of `opt` in this step. 

Then, activate the virtual environment with:
```bash
$ source opt/bin/activate
```

You should see `(opt):` prepended to the prompt: 
```bash
(opt): $
```

Finally, install required python packages with `pip` (this step will take awhile):

```bash
(opt) $ pip install numpy pandas ipykernel amplpy
```

The `ipykernel` module is needed to turn this virtual environment into a Jupyter kernel at a later step and
the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/amplpy" target="_blank">`amplpy`</a> package is the Python interface to `AMPL`. 

We can now use both AMPL and Knitro on interactive Yen nodes.

After the packages are installed, start the Python REPL by typing `python`:
```bash
(opt) $ python
```

Test that you can import `amplpy` and that it is using the network license:

```python
Python 3.10.12 (main, Nov 20 2023, 15:14:05) [GCC 11.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

Make sure you can import AMPL and the license is the network floating license:

```python
import os, sys
from amplpy import AMPL, Environment

# Initialize the AMPL instance with an AMPL license
ampl = AMPL(Environment("/software/non-free/ampl/20231031"))

try:
    # Execute your AMPL commands here
    ampl.eval("option version;")    
    # Set Knitro as the solver
    ampl.setOption('solver', "/software/non-free/knitro-12.1.1/knitro-12.1.1-Linux-64/knitroampl/knitroampl")
    # Define and solve your optimization problem
    ampl.eval('''
    # Simple Linear Optimization Problem
    var x >= 0;   # Decision variable x
    var y >= 0;   # Decision variable y
    maximize objective: x + 2 * y;  # Objective function
    subject to Constraint1: 3 * x + 4 * y <= 24;  # Constraint 1
    ''')
    ampl.solve()
finally:
    # Output the results
    print(f"Objective value: {ampl.getObjective('objective').value()}")
    print(f"x = {ampl.getVariable('x').value()}")
    print(f"y = {ampl.getVariable('y').value()}")
    # Properly close the AMPL instance
    ampl.close()

```

We point to the AMPL floating network license with `AMPL(Environment("/software/non-free/ampl/20231031"))` call.

The `ampl.eval()` call should indicate that we have checked out the license:

```
option version 'AMPL Development Version 20231213 (Linux-5.15.0-1052-azure, 64-bit)\
Licensed to Stanford University, Natalya Rapstine <nrapstin@stanford.edu> (srcc-license-srcf).\
Temporary license expires 20250131.\
Using license file "/software/non-free/ampl/20231031/ampl.lic".\
';
```

!!!Note
    To ensure that the AMPL instance is always properly released (even in cases of errors or exceptions), 
    we must properly close `ampl` instance. The `try` and `finally` logic does that in which we release the AMPL license with `ampl.close()` call. 

We also point to the Yen's Knitro licence with `ampl.setOption()` call.

After defining the problem, the `ampl.solve()` call should print out the Knitro license information and the problem solution.

```python
: 
=======================================
           Academic License
       (NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE)
         Artelys Knitro 12.1.1
=======================================

WARNING: Problem appears to have nonlinear equalities and be non-convex.
         The Knitro mixed integer solver is designed for convex problems.
         For non-convex problems it is only a heuristic, and the reported
         bounds and optimality claims cannot be verified.
```

Exit the REPL.
 
If you are done working interactively and want to deactivate the virtual environment and remove all modules, run:
```bash
$ deactivate
$ module purge
```

The environment is now set up to run your Python scripts that use AMPL and Knitro on the interactive Yen nodes.
Remember that the `module load` command and virtual environment activation is only active in the current shell.

!!!Important
    You need to load the `ampl` and `knitro` modules and activate your `venv` environment every time you log in to the Yens
    before running the interactive Python scripts that use AMPL and Knitro. 


## Integrating with Jupyter Notebooks

#### Running Gurobi in Jupyter Notebooks
To make Gurobi Python interface work on the Yen's JupyterHub, we can take our previous `venv` environment and
make it into a Jupyter kernel.

Load `gurobipy3` module:
```bash
$ ml gurobipy3
```

Activate the virtual environment in your project space:

```bash
$ cd <path/to/project>
$ source opt/bin/activate
```

Then, we add the **active** `opt` virtual environment as a new JupyterHub kernel:

```bash
(opt) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=gurobipy \
--env GUROBI_HOME /software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi1000/linux64 \
--env GRB_LICENSE_FILE /software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi1000/linux64/gurobi.lic \
--env PATH '/software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi1000/linux64/bin:${PATH}' \
--env LD_LIBRARY_PATH '/software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi1000/linux64/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}'
```

Notice the extra `--env` arguments to add necessary Gurobi environment variables so that Jupyter kernel 
can find the software. 


List all of your Jupyter kernels:
```
(opt) $ jupyter kernelspec list
```

To remove a kernel, run:
```
(opt) $ jupyter kernelspec uninstall <kernel-name>
```
where `<kernel-name>` is the name of the kernel you want to uninstall from JupyterHub.


On [JupyterHub](/_getting_started/jupyter/){:target="_blank"}, launch the new `gurobipy` kernel 
and test the package imports.


![](/images/gurobi-kernel.png)


#### Running AMPL/Knitro in Jupyter Notebooks
To make AMPL/Knitro Python interface work on the Yen's JupyterHub, we can take our previous `venv` environment and
make it into a Jupyter kernel.

Load AMPL and Knitro modules:
```bash
$ ml ampl knitro
```

Activate the virtual environment in your project space:

```bash
$ cd <path/to/project>
$ source opt/bin/activate
```

Then, we add the **active** `opt` virtual environment as a new JupyterHub kernel:

```bash
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=opt \
--env KNITRODIR /software/non-free/knitro-12.1.1/knitro-12.1.1-Linux-64 \
--env ARTELYS_LICENSE_NETWORK_ADDR license4.stanford.edu \
--env LD_LIBRARY_PATH '/software/non-free/knitro-12.1.1/knitro-12.1.1-Linux-64/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}' \
--env PYTHONPATH '/software/non-free/knitro-12.1.1/knitro-12.1.1-Linux-64/examples/Python:${PYTHONPATH}'
```

Notice the extra `--env` arguments to add necessary Knitro and AMPL environment variables so that Jupyter kernel 
can find the licenses. 

Launch the new `opt` kernel and test the `ampl` and `knitro` imports.

![](/images/opt_kernel.png)
![](/images/opt_kernel-2.png)


#### Combining Gurobi, Knitro, and AMPL in a Single Kernel
Consider combining the instructions for Gurobi and AMPL/Knitro to make a single "optimization" virtual 
environment and Jupyter kernel. After loading `gurobipy3`, `ampl` and `knitro` modules, make the virtual environment,
 activate it, then `pip install` all the required packages - `numpy pandas ipykernel threadpoolctl scipy gurobipy amplpy`.
 
You can then make that active virtual environment into a new Jupyter kernel combining the environment variables we used previously:

```bash
(opt) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=opt \
--env GUROBI_HOME /software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi1000/linux64 \
--env GRB_LICENSE_FILE /software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi1000/linux64/gurobi.lic \
--env KNITRODIR /software/non-free/knitro-12.1.1/knitro-12.1.1-Linux-64 \
--env ARTELYS_LICENSE_NETWORK_ADDR license4.stanford.edu \
--env LD_LIBRARY_PATH '/software/non-free/knitro-12.1.1/knitro-12.1.1-Linux-64/lib:/software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi1000/linux64/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}' \
--env PATH '/software/non-free/Gurobi/gurobi1000/linux64/bin:${PATH}' \
--env PYTHONPATH '/software/non-free/knitro-12.1.1/knitro-12.1.1-Linux-64/examples/Python:${PYTHONPATH}'
```

On [JupyterHub](/_getting_started/jupyter/){:target="_blank"}, launch the new `opt` kernel 
and test the package imports for `amplpy`, `gurobipy` and all other previous imports.

!!!Note
    If you already have a Jupyter kernel named `opt`, choose a different name for the combined Gurobi, AMPL and Knitro kernel. Otherwise, the `opt` kernel will be overwritten to reference the latest kernel install from the active environment.

## Running Batch Jobs with Slurm
The Yen-Slurm cluster is comprised of 7 shared compute nodes that use [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html){:target="_blank"} to schedule jobs and manage a queue of resources.
(if there are more requests than resouces available). It is a batch submission environment like the [Sherlock HPC](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu){:target="_blank"} cluster.
 
We can use the same `opt` virtual environment to run python code on the Slurm nodes. 

We load the optimization software modules, activate the virtual python environment before calling `python` in
the slurm script. Let's save this slurm script to a file named `test-opt.slurm`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example of running Gurobi, AMPL and Knitro on Yens

#SBATCH -J opt
#SBATCH -p normal
#SBATCH -c 1                         # one core per task
#SBATCH -t 1:00:00
##SBATCH --mem=1gb                   # uncomment/set to request total RAM need
#SBATCH -o opt-%j.out
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=your_email@stanford.edu

# Clean modules first
module purge

# Load software
module load gurobipy3 ampl knitro

# Activate venv (can either be a global or relative path)
source /zfs/projects/<your-project>/opt/bin/activate

# Run python script
python <your-script.py>
```

In this example, we load all three optimization software, but you can omit the ones you don't need.

Submit to test:

```bash
$ sbatch test-opt.slurm
```

See your job in the queue:


```bash
$ squeue
```


Display the `.out` file once the job is done.

```bash
$ cat *.out
```

## Running Job Arrays with Slurm

A Slurm job array is a way to launch multiple jobs in parallel. One use case is when you want to change input parameters in your script (such as a Python, Julia, or R script). Instead of manually changing the input parameters and rerunning the script multiple times, you can achieve this with a single job array.

#### Gurobi Example
We will work with the following python script that was modified from [Gurobi documentation](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation){:target="_blank"}.

This script formulates and solves a simple Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model using the Gurobi matrix API:

![](../images/gurobi-eq.png)

Save this Python script to a new file called `gurobi_example.py`.

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.sparse as sp
import gurobipy as gp
import sys
from threadpoolctl import threadpool_limits
from gurobipy import GRB

# Limits the number of cores for numpy BLAS
threadpool_limits(limits = 1, user_api = 'blas')

# Set total number of threads for Gurobi to
__gurobi_threads = 1

try:

    # Define the coefficients to run sensitivity analysis
    capacity_coefficients = np.linspace(1, 10, num=32)

    # Assign a based on command line input - default is 0
    if len(sys.argv) > 1 and int(sys.argv[1]) < 31:
        a = capacity_coefficients[int(sys.argv[1])]
    else:
        a = 0

    # Create a new model
    m = gp.Model("matrix1")

    # Set the total number of Gurobi threads for model "m"
    m.Params.threads = __gurobi_threads

    # Create variables
    x = m.addMVar(shape=3, vtype=GRB.BINARY, name="x")

    # Set objective
    obj = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 2.0])
    m.setObjective(obj @ x, GRB.MAXIMIZE)

    # Build (sparse) constraint matrix
    data = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, -1.0, -1.0])
    row = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1])
    col = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1])

    A = sp.csr_matrix((data, (row, col)), shape=(2, 3))

    # Build rhs vector
    rhs = np.array([4.0 + a, -1.0])

    # Add constraints
    m.addConstr(A @ x <= rhs, name="c")

    # Optimize model
    m.optimize()

    print(f"Solved LP with a = {a}")
    print(f"Optimal Solution: {x.X}")
    print(f"Obj: {m.objVal}")

except gp.GurobiError as e:
    print(f"Error code {str(e.errno)}: {str(e)}")

except AttributeError:
    print(f"Encountered an attribute error")
```

This python script can be run with `python gurobi_example.py` with no command line argument (`a` is set to 0 by default).
However, we will run it via the scheduler on the Yen-Slurm cluster.

Here is an example Slurm script, that loads `gurobipy3` module, activates `venv`, and runs `gurobi_example.py` script. Save this Slurm script to a file named sensitivity_analysis.slurm:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example of running a single Gurobi run for sensitivity analysis

#SBATCH -J gurobi
#SBATCH -p normal
#SBATCH -c 1                              # one core per task
#SBATCH -t 1:00:00
##SBATCH --mem=1gb
#SBATCH -o gurobi-%j.out
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=your_email@stanford.edu

# Clean modules first
module purge

# Load software
module load gurobipy3

# Activate venv (can either be a global or relative path)
source /zfs/projects/<your-project>/opt/bin/activate

# Run python script
# with no command line arg: a = 0 in the script
python gurobi_example.py
```

You will need to modify the path to your `venv` enviroment as well as your email address. After that, you
can submit the script to run with `sbatch sensitivity_analysis.slurm`

Next, we will modify this Slurm script to run as a job array.
Each task in a job array will run the same Python script with a unique argument.

We will pass an index as a command line argument to the Python script, which performs sensitivity analysis. The Python script will set the value of `a` based on the corresponding array element. For example, if we run the Python script with the argument `5`, the script will assign the value corresponding to the 5th element in the user-defined capacity coefficient array.

We also want to ensure that we limit the threads to 1 in both `numpy` and Gurobi since we will be launching one task per CPU core. The following lines in the Python script accomplish this:


```python
# Limits the number of cores for numpy BLAS
threadpool_limits(limits = 1, user_api = 'blas')

# Set total number of threads for Gurobi to
__gurobi_threads = 1
```

Now, our Slurm script should look like below (save this to `sensitivity_analysis_array.slurm`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example of running a job array to run Gurobi python script for sensitivity analysis.

#SBATCH --array=0-31              # there is a max array size - 512 tasks
#SBATCH -J gurobi
#SBATCH -p normal
#SBATCH -c 1                      # one core per task
#SBATCH -t 1:00:00
##SBATCH --mem=1gb
#SBATCH -o gurobi-%A-%a.out
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=your_email@stanford.edu

# Clean modules first
module purge

# Load software
module load gurobipy3

# Activate venv (can either be a global or relative path)
source /zfs/projects/<your-project>/opt/bin/activate

# Run python script with a command line arg from --array option
# It will be an input index from 0 to 31
python gurobi_example.py $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
```

Again, you will have to modify the script to use your `venv` environment and your email. 

Note that in this case, we specify Slurm option `#SBATCH --array=0-31` to run 32 tasks in parallel.
The maximum job array index is 511 (`--array=0-511`) on Yen-Slurm. All tasks will be launched as independent jobs. 
There is a limit of 200 concurrent jobs per user that could be running at the same time. Each task will generate a unique log file
`gurobi-%A-%a.out` where `%A` will be the unique job ID and `%a` will be the unique task ID (from 0 to 31).

After modifying the path to your `venv` environment, submit the `sensitivity_analysis_array.slurm` script to the scheduler to run the job array on the cluster. It will launch all 32 tasks at the same time (some might sit in the queue while others are going to run right away). To submit, run:

```
$ sbatch sensitivity_analysis_array.slurm
```

Monitor your jobs with `watch squeue -u $USER` where `$USER` is your SUNet ID. Check which job array tasks failed.
Rerun those by setting `--array=` only to failed indices.

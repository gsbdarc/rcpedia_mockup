# How do I transfer files to and from Yen Servers to Google Drive using `rclone`?
For versatile data transfers, you can employ <a href="https://rclone.org/" target="_blank">`rclone`</a>, which supports various destinations, including Google Drive, Amazon S3, Dropbox and others.

## Using `rclone` to Transfer Files to Google Drive

### Using `rclone` Locally
**On Windows**: download from <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>.

**On Mac**: install `rclone` with:

```
$ curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Using `rclone` on Yen Servers
To utilize `rclone` the yens, load the `rclone` module:

```bash
$ ml rclone
```

Verify the loaded module with:
```bash
$ ml

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) rclone/1.63.1
```

#### Setting up `rclone`
Before we can push data from the yens to Google Drive, we need to configure `rclone` once.
```bash
$ rclone config
```

The configuration menu will be presented:
```bash
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> nrapstinGoogleDrive
```
Select `n` to make a new remote and give it a name when prompted. For example, `$USERGoogleDrive` where
`$USER` is your SUNet ID.

Next, select the number corresponding to Google Drive (the menu changes with rclone version so be careful to select
the right remote).

```bash
18 / Google Drive
   \ (drive)
```

```bash
Storage> 18
```

When prompted for the next two options, leave them blank and press Enter.

Then the next menu asks to select permissions you want to give `rclone`. Choose `1` for full read-write
access.

```bash
scope> 1
```

Then leave the next prompt blank and press Enter.

Choose `n` to not edit advanced config:

```bash
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
```

Choose `n` again since we are working on the remote Yen server:

```bash
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> n
```

Next, we need to finish configuring Google drive using the local machine.
For that, you will need to install rclone locally and in the local terminal, run

```bash
$ rclone authorize "drive" "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
where "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" is the config token that you see in the Yen terminal from the previous step.

This will open up a local web browser in which you can authenticate into your Google Drive using your Stanford account.

 Once you authorize `rclone` for access, Google Drive will give a code to paste back into the Yen terminal. Copy the code
and paste it back into the Yen terminal after `config_token>`.

Next, you will be asked if you want to configure this as a team drive. Press `y` if you are connecting
to a shared Google Drive or press `n` if you are connecting to your Google Drive.

```bash
Configure this as a team drive?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
```

Finally, press Enter to complete the config.

```bash
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>
```

In the last prompt, hit `q` to quit. Now, `rclone` should be set up to push files from the yens to your
Google Drive.

#### Using `rclone`

Here are common `rclone` commands for transferring files between Yen servers and Google Drive:

* list remote connections:

```bash
$ rclone listremotes
```

* Create a remote folder on Google Drive (within your Google Drive base folder):

```bash
$ rclone mkdir $USERGoogleDrive:GoogleDriveFolderName
```

Alternatively, you can specify the path to the new folder on Google Drive:

```bash
$ rclone mkdir $USERGoogleDrive:myFolder/subfolder/data
```
where I already had `myFolder` directory on my Google drive and within `myFolder` I
have already created `subfolder`. This `rclone` command will make a new folder -- `data`.

* List contents of a remote folder on Google Drive:

```bash
$ rclone ls $USERGoogleDrive:GoogleDriveFolderName
```

* Upload a directory to Google Drive from Yen Servers:

```bash
$ rclone copy /Yen_Path/To/Folder/ $USERGoogleDrive:GoogleDriveFolderName/
```

where `/Path/To/Folder/` is the path on the yens to the directory you want to upload.

* Download from Google Drive to Yen Servers:

```bash
$ rclone copy $USERGoogleDrive:GoogleDriveFolderName /Yen_Path/To/Folder/
```
where `/Yen_Path/To/Folder/` is the path on the yens where you want to copy files to.
